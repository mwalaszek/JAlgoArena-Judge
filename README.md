# JAlgoArena Judge Agent [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mwalaszek/JAlgoArena-Judge.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mwalaszek/JAlgoArena-Judge)

JAlgoArena Judge Agent is heart of JAlgoArena platform. It is responsible for generation of skeleton code as well as judging submissions based on requirements specified in problem definition.

## Introduction

- JAlgoArena Judge Agent can be easily scalable - it's stateless and together with Eureka and API using Ribbon load balancer gives unlimited way to scale judgement capability
- It supports Kotlin and Java
- JAlgoArena Judge Agent is generating skeleton code for particular problem - based on meta data received from Problems Service
- It judges correctness of the solution based on the pre-specified test cases as well as time and memory limits
- It's using simple heuristic to calculate time and memory results - running in couple iteration and looking for best results makes the judgement itself more predictable and repeatable

# REST API

| Endpoint | Description |
| ---- | --------------- |
| [GET /problems](https://jalgoarena.herokuapp.com/problems) | Get problems list |
| [GET /problems/:id](https://jalgoarena.herokuapp.com/problems/fib) | Get problem by id |
| [POST /problems/:id/submit](https://jalgoarena.herokuapp.com/problems/fib/submit) | Post problem solution to judge |

## Components

- [JAlgoArena](https://github.com/spolnik/JAlgoArena)
- [JAlgoArena UI](https://github.com/spolnik/JAlgoArena-UI)
- [JAlgoArena Judge](https://github.com/spolnik/JAlgoArena-Judge)
- [JAlgoArena Problems](https://github.com/spolnik/JAlgoArena-Problems)
- [JAlgoArena Eureka Server](https://github.com/spolnik/JAlgoArena-Eureka)
- [JAlgoArena API Gateway](https://github.com/spolnik/JAlgoArena-API)

## Continuous Delivery

- initially, developer push his changes to GitHub
- in next stage, GitHub notifies Travis CI about changes
- Travis CI runs whole continuous integration flow, running compilation, tests and generating reports
- coverage report is sent to Codecov
- application is deployed into Heroku machine

## Infrastructure

- Heroku (PaaS)
- Kotlin Compiler (K2JVMCompiler), MemoryClassLoader, MemoryJavaCompiler
- Spring Boot, Spring Cloud (Eureka Client)
- TravisCI - https://travis-ci.org/spolnik/JAlgoArena-Judge

## Running locally

There are two ways to run it - from sources or from binaries.
- Default port: `8080`

### Running from binaries
- go to [releases page](https://github.com/spolnik/JAlgoArena-Judge/releases) and download last app package (JAlgoArena-Judge-[version_number].zip)
- after unpacking it, go to folder and run `./run.sh`
- you can modify port Eureka service url in run.sh script, depending on your infrastructure settings. The script itself can be found in here: [run.sh](run.sh)

### Running from sources
- run `git clone https://github.com/spolnik/JAlgoArena-Judge` to clone locally the sources
- now, you can build project with command `./gradlew clean bootRepackage` which will create runnable jar package with app sources. Next, run `java -Dserver.port=8080 -classpath "lib/*" -jar build/libs/jalgoarena-auth-*.jar` which will start application
- there is second way to run app with gradle. Instead of running above, you can just run `./gradlew clean bootRun`

## Notes
